# Introduction

Edge UI is a sleek and stylish React component library with a modern flair, derived from the [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com).

Edge UI also comes with optimized text formatting, light and dark modes, ensuring that your users will have a seamless experience no matter their preferences.
Additionally, its highly scalable components allow you to build responsive and flexible interfaces that can adapt to any screen size or resolution.
